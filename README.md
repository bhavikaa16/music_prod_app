# Music Services Module (Flutter Project)

🧠 My Approach
To build this project, I followed the MVVM architecture to maintain a clean separation between UI, business logic, and data handling. I used Firebase Firestore as the backend to store service details, enabling dynamic content updates without changing the code. The app fetches data asynchronously using a ServiceRepository, manages state through a ServiceViewModel, and updates the UI in real-time using Provider. Each service card, styled based on the Figma design, displays data loaded from Firestore and supports navigation to a detailed screen on tap. This structure ensures modularity, scalability, and a responsive user experience.
